# OS-Icons
This is a forum project but if you're trying to find some OS icons, you are in the right place.
When I saw that my forum's icons were so bad, I decided to try to fix them with better icons.

I took some of the Windows logo's from the DeviantArt user named MohamadouWindowsXP10.

I took some of the macOS logo's [Sonoma to El Capitan (excluding Ventura)] from macOS Icon Gallery.

Most of my Linux icons were taken from a thing named "Ant√º". If you search "antu distributor logo" in Google,
you will find most of them. I think OG project is this: https://github.com/fabianalexisinostroza/Antu-icons
